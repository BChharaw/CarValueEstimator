#imported packages are required to be installed for this program to work, including tensorflow, numpy
#This was a project I developed while doing the FreeCodeCamp Python Neural Networks for beginners course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/ using a similar approach to defining the network as in the tutorial with a different dataset.
#re routing the path to the test.csv and train.csv files is required for the file to be loaded into the pandas dataframe
