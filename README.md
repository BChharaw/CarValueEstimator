A linear regression model to estimate the value of a vehicle using mileage, age, engine power, and transmission type using the CarDekho Vehicle Dataset with data cleaned in Google Sheets.
This was a project I developed while doing the FreeCodeCamp Python Neural Networks for beginners course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/ using a similar approach to defining the network as in the tutorial with a different dataset and feature columns.
Re routing the path to the test.csv and train.csv files is required for the file to be loaded into the pandas dataframe
Imported packages are required to be installed for this program to work, including tensorflow, numpy, and pandas.
